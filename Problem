Here is the list of problems with Dario's fork.

-- Verbose Logging works poorly. In the vanilla version it's way easier to see what's going on.

-- It's basically impossible to have gists with a Puzzlescript project using the fork.

-- You can't share Puzzlescript games with a fork. You have to use Github for this.

Surprisingly, the problem is also present with other forks.
